Sorting algorithms demo
=======================

A Java desktop GUI program that shows an animation of a sorting algorithm in action.
Over a dozen sort algos are supported (e.g. bubble sort, insertion sort, heapsort, quick sort).
The array size and execution speed can be customized by the user.

This package also includes a simple command line program and JUnit test suite.
